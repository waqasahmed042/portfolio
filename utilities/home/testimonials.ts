From the beginning, Aamir was communicative and highly responsive, always eager to understand my requirements in detail. He consistently kept me updated on his progress and was quick to implement changes, even providing video demos to make sure everything was on track. Despite the technical challenges, Aamir showed great flexibility and went above and beyond to troubleshoot compatibility issues, even offering discounted rates as our collaboration continued. His dedication and professionalism were evident in every interaction, and his expertise with Microsoft Word made a big difference. Looking forward to working with Aamir again on future projects â€“ highly recommended!",
